# Documenting Endpoints

Oftentimes project teams will have notes in the form of partial docs or wikis. The TW starts with these and starts to craft the documentation for a new API endpoint.

As with model documentation, a big part of what the TW does with API docs is to structure the information in a better format, enabling easy skimming.

## Sections of API Documentation

Recommend the following sections for many REST API docs: 

- resource description
- endpoints and methods
- parameters
- request example
- response example and schema
