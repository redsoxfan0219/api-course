What is an API?


Application Program interface. It serves as the interaction layer between a requesting service and
a requestor, typically on the Web.


What is a REST API?


REST = Representational State Transfer. It's a style of API and not a standard. REST APIs rely on HTTP to deliver requests from a requestor in order to return a response to the requestor.

Typically, the vehicle for this exchange is a JSON file, favored for being lightweight and thus preferred for speed. However, any data format can be used for the API request-response


How do rest APIs differ from other types of APIs?


There are native APIs, which rely on language-specific designs. Web APIs, of which REST APIs are 
one type, are language-agnostic.

Besides REST APIs, the other main kind of web APIs are SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocols) APIs.
The main differences are structure and speed. SOAPs rely on a highly structured XML request and response. This makes them slow. 

SOAPs are now primarily involved in legacy systems and in highly regulated industries, like finance.
